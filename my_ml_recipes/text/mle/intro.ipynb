    "Suppose we are given a problem where we can assume the _parametric class_ of distribution (e.g. Normal Distribution) that generates a set of data. Since this class of distribution has a finite number of parameters that need to be figured out (mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ in case of normal distribution) in order to identify the particular member of the class, we will use the given data to do so.\n",

    "Let us consider a Ransom Variable $X$ to be normally distributed with some mena $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. We need to estimate $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ using our samples which accurately represent the actual $X$ and not just the samples that we have drawn out."
